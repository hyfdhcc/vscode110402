/// See <class>%XGEN.AbstractDocument</class> for an overview of XGEN.<br/>
/// A sequence is a container that can hold one or more nodes within
/// an XGEN document. A sequence does the following:
/// <ol>
/// <li><i>optionally</i> Generates one or more lines of code before processing its children.</li>
/// <li>Loops over the child nodes within the sequence and asks each one to generate code in turn.</li>
/// <li><i>optionally</i> Generates one or more lines of code after processing its children.</li>
/// </ol>
/// To create a new sequence within a XGEN document, create a 
/// subclass of this class and override the <method>%OnBeforeGenerateCode</method>
/// and <method>%OnAfterGenerateCode</method> methods to generate sequence-specific
/// code.<br/>
/// Note that a subclass can prevent its child nodes from being processed by
/// setting the <property>skipChildren</property> property to 1 in its
/// <method>%OnBeforeGenerateCode</method> method.
