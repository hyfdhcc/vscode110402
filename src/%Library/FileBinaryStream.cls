/// Stream class that stores binary data in external files.
/// This class is deprecated in favor of <class>%Stream.FileBinary</class>.
/// For example the following code opens a file binary stream, points it at a particular file
/// on the filesystem and then reads it in chunks of 32,000 bytes:
/// <example>
/// Set stream=##class(%FileBinaryStream).%New()
/// Set stream.Filename="c:\myfile.txt"
/// While 'stream.AtEnd {
/// Set line=stream.Read()
/// ; Process the chunk here
/// }
/// </example>
