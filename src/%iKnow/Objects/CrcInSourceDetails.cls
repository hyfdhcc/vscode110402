/// <p>Note: the use of this class is no longer recommended for accessing elements of a specific domain.
/// For those scenarios, <class>%iKnow.Tables.Utils</class> offers a more flexible and customizable
/// way of projecting iKnow domain data to SQL</p>
///  <p>This is a read-only object representation wrapping the internal iKnow data structures for 
///  Unique CRCs, occurring in a specific source. This class groups the aggregated frequency
///  and dominance information of a particular CRC in a particular source.</p>
///  <p>This class can be used from Cache ObjectScript or SQL to access a single or small number of
///  entries, but the storage mappings are not meant to support elaborate or complex queries
///  targeting this SQL table.</p>
///  <p>Please use the predefined queries in <class>%iKnow.Queries.EntityAPI</class>,
///  <class>%iKnow.Semantics.DominanceAPI</class> and other query classes
///  to consult Entity data as the internal global structures are designed to optimize performance for
///  these queries rather than general-purpose access.</p>
///  <p>NOTE: This object assumes all underlying data structures are present. Use domain-specific
///  copies of these objects for domains where not all indices are built. See also the 
///  GenerateAllObjectsForDomain() method in <class>%iKnow.Objects.Utils</class>.</p>
