/// This class implements an EntityResolver that always returns an empty stream.
/// It can be used to defeat the default entity resolution performed by the SAX, XPATH 
/// and XSLT processors. You may want to defeat such processing because even though you
/// may not be performing validation on an XML document, the processors will still attempt
/// to resolve external entities which can be very time consuming, especially if they are
/// referenced by an URL on the network
